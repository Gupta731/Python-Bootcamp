Musical time machine asks us which date in the past we want to visit. Once we give the date, the program scraps billboard website to get the top 100 songs for that week.
It then uses the Spotify API to search the URI code for each of the 100 songs and then in a separate request to spotify creates a playlist and adds the songs into it.
We can then open our Spotify web app or mobile app to view and listen to our nostalgic playlist.
Concepts Used: Web Scraping, API requests, exception handling, functions, environment variables, etc.

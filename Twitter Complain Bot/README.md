This Python Bot can automatically tweet to our Internet Service Provider(ISP) complaining about our internet speed.
It opens the speed test website and checks for our internet speed, if the download or upload speed is below our service provider's promised limit then it logs in to twitter and puts a tweet to our ISP.
It can then automatically log out of twitter and close the browser window.

In this blog website, I have made use of Flask framework available with Python. The contents to show up as blogs is fetched using API requests to a npoint data dump and passed onto a class to create object.
There are separate blog pages to which we can redirect from homepage. There is also a about page and contact section.
I have also made use of templating language Jinja along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The message posted by user in contact section can be received by us through email using smtplib.

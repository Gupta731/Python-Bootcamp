One my most worked upon projects on reaching Day 70 of Bootcamp, The Blog website FullStack webapp.
I have made use of Python Flask framework with RESTful routing. The homepage shows a list of blogs published by users of the webapp. The users can view the blogs, register and login into their accounts and also comment in different blogs. Each blog can also be opened in a separate webpage for more details.
The admin can add, edit or delete existing blogs.
The message posted by fans in contact section can be received by us through email using smtplib.

Concepts Used: Python Flask Framework, SQLAlchemy, WTForms, Flask Login, RESTful routing, Jinja, HTML , CSS

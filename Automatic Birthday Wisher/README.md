Automatic birthday wisher can send birthday wishes to our friends and relatives without our intervention. When hosted on cloud platforms like PythonAnywhere or others, this code can run at a scheduled time everyday.
The birthday list can be saves in a csv file with Tkinter GUI. The program while running goes through the csv file using pandas and checks if any birthdays fall on today's date.

Appropriate error handling and message boxes are provided to make the program run smooth and guide the user in providing correct inputs.
Concepts used: Tkinter, Pandas, smtplib, error handling, datetime module, os module, opening and reading files, etc.

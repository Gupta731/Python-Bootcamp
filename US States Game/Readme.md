# US States Game
I have created this addictive and awesome state guessing game for US. This is super useful for kids and adults alike. We can make this for any country. Hope you like it.
Whenever the player guesses a correct state name, the state gets marked. The player has to guess 50 states in total. 
If he is not able to, then this game also creates a csv file suggesting the name of states he/she needs to learn.
Concepts Used: Pandas, Turtle, OOP, etc.

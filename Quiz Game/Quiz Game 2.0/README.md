The earlier quiz game is now modified to have an UI using class based Tkinter. The OOP concept is maintained throughout the program.
The code now uses API requests to get the list of questions instead of hardcoded questions and puts it into the UI. It also features True and False buttons, so now the user dont have to manually enter answers.
The UI turns green or red if the answer provided is correct or incorrect respectively. The question number and score are also tracked in the UI.

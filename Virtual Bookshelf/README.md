Virtual bookshelf is a simple website to keep track of books that we have read and give them a rating.
The home page shows all the books that we have added till now. We can add new books, edit & delete existing ones. 
All the details are stored in database using Object relational mapping with SQLAlchemy.

Concepts Used: Python Flask framework, WTForms, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

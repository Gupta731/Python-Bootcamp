Stock news alert app can help us track our favourite stocks or some stock we are invested in. It uses api calls to get the price change of the share in last 2 days.
If there is rise or fall of more than 5%, it triggers another api call to get the recent news articles related to the stock.
The program then notifies the user through email about the price change along with 3 recent news articles associated with it.

Language flashcard app can help learn words from a different language. The app shows an english word and expects the user to click yes or no button signifying whether the user knows the word or is yet to learn.
The card flips to show the word in a different language after 3s. Currently I have made this for English and French but the app can be modified to suite the needs.
If the user is yet to learn a word the app keeps a track of those and shows them more frequently to the user.
Concepts used: Tkinter, Pandas, exception handling, functions etc.

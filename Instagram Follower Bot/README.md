This instagram follower bot program uses Selenium WebDriver with Python OOP.
It automatically logs in to Instagram with our email and password and then goes to any target account of our choice. Once in the account page, the bot determines who are the followers of this page and then clicks the follow button against all those accounts.
The bot then automatically logs off from our instagram account.

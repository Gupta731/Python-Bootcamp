Amazon automated price tracker scraps the amazon product link provided by you and gets hold of the price component. It then compares the price with the amount provided you.
If the price of the product is less than our price then we receive an automated email mentioning the item and its price along with the link to buy it.
If hosted on cloud, this code can repeatedly check if the price has dropped and immediately send us a notification.
Concepts Used: Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup, smtplib.
